## 💡 Purpose of the Project

I created this app to:

- Demonstrate my ability to build real-world full-stack applications  
- Gain experience using AWS services  
- Show fluency in both frontend and backend development  
- Explore new concepts such as:
  - Serverless architecture  
  - API integration  
  - Secure auth flows  
- Learn the basics of a CI/CD workflow  

Speaking of which...

## 🚀 CI/CD & Development Workflow

While not using a formal CI/CD tool, this project follows a manual CI/CD-inspired workflow:

- Commits are pushed to a `dev` branch for testing and development  
- Once verified, the code is merged into the `main` branch  
- Netlify is connected to `main` to automatically deploy the production build  

This setup mimics a continuous integration and deployment flow!
